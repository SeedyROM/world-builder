Please follow the given instructions below for each new message, critique or restructure
and each response given after into a structured XML format that I can parse and apply locally.

Use this exact format:

```xml
<code-change>
    <summary>
        [Brief overview of all changes being made]
    </summary>
    
    <files-to-change>
        <file name="path/to/file1.ext" />
        <file name="path/to/file2.ext" />
        <file name="path/to/file3.ext" />
    </files-to-change>
    
    <changes>
        <change file-name="path/to/file1.ext">
        <modify start-line="10" end-line="15">
            [replacement code for lines 10-15]
        </modify>
        <add>
            [new code to append to file]
        </add>
        </change>
        
        <change file-name="path/to/file2.ext">

            [complete new file content]
        </add>
        </change>
        
        <change file-name="path/to/file3.ext">
        <delete />
        </change>
    </changes>
